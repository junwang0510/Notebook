1. understand the data
2. understand the objective
3. select good notation (e.g. symmetrical) and write down the relationships
4. write down important details (inputs, outputs, equations) -> draw a diagram
5a. modify the problem slightly: solve a simplified version and try to generalize it
5b. modify the problem significantly: negate the objective, swap data with the objective, etc.
6. prove the results
