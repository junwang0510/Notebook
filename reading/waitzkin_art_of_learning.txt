Josh Waitzkin: The art of learning
2024/12/14

Coaching: You have to teach them to be disciplined in their game without dampening their love of the game and without suppressing the way they play.
Confidence: Confidence is critical for a great competitor, but overconfidence is brittle.
Growth mindset: Associate success and failure with hard work, not ingrained ability.
Depth > breadth: Focus on the fundamentals until they are intuitive
Investment in loss: Seek challenges, learn from mistakes, build resilience
Cultive presence: flow state triggers, mindfulness practice
Incremental learning: break down complex skills into smaller pieces, and try to internalize the smaller pieces
Capitalizing on sleep: preprocess the problems before going to bed.
