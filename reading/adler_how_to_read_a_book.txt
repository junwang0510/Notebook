- 4 level of reading: elementary -> inspectional -> analytical -> syntopical
- why you are reading should match how you are reading
- elementary: literal meanings of words and sentences
- inspectional: (1) systematic skimming: skim to get structure and main ideas (2) superficial reading: read the entire thing without pausing
- analytical: classify -> abstract -> enumerate major parts and relations -> define the problem
- syntopical: related works -> translate and synthesize -> formulate your questions -> discuss with authors
- note-taking: highlight, number points in an argument, cross-reference related ideas with page numbers, formuate your questions and write the answers
